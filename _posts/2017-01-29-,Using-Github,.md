    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt a lot like in the previous lesson. I experimented with new parts of the manual. The strategies for learning that were effective were occasionally swapping with my partner from "pilot" to “navigator” and repeating the process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that I did not know how to save my work. I can get round this by planning in advance to save my work rather than leaving it to the very end and losing my work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will aim to be better prepared for saving my work. I will improve my learning by consulting my manual more frequently and discussing with my partner what steps we need to take next. I will try to be more experimental in my approach to using fuzebox.</td>
